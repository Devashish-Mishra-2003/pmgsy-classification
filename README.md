# Intelligent Classification of PMGSY Rural Infrastructure Projects

This project builds a machine learning model using IBM Watson Studio (AutoAI)
to classify rural road/bridge projects under PMGSY into the correct scheme (PMGSY-I, II, RCPLWEA, etc.)

## 🔧 Tools Used
- IBM Cloud Services
- IBM Watson Studio (AutoAI)
- Python (AutoAI-generated code)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## 📁 Files
- `pmgsy_model.ipynb` – Training and evaluation notebook
- `pmgsy_dataset.csv` – Project-level dataset
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 📊 Goal
Accurately classify projects using physical and financial features such as cost, road length, region, and timelines.
